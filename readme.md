Overview
===

This is an EMR targeted clone of tspurway/infernyx

Notes
===

create default emr roles with the aws cli

jar files are deployed onto hadoop clusters straight out of github

it basically works, I just need to get my last bits in order:

* sqs
* redshift
* actually use a geop database
* insert the real `locale_whitelist`
* deploying jars from local dir or s3 instead of github
